        <p>
            Now, I know what you're thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="color:#c0c0c0"><i>"GPL v3 for a mod maker? Doesn't that mean all mods made with this also get placed under GPL v3?"</i></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            To my understanding, <span style="color:#ff0000">no, not directly.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            As all resulting mods created by end users using this tool contain neither original nor modified code from this tool or any libraries that this tool uses, I am somewhat sure that it does not directly require the end users to also place their mod under a GPL v3 license.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you delve into the realm of scripting though, <i>then</i> you start playing with fire. For instance, after making a mod with my tool, you then decided to create a script within said mod that listens for events that Mindustry (or any mods thereof that aren't Java mods or just sprite/sound replacements, because Mindustry is licensed under GPL v3) throws and/or calls functions that are defined within the vanilla game or mods, it would (to my best understanding) require you to publish your mod under GPL v3 as well.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The bottom line: If you don't use stuff that Mindustry throws or listens for (or mods doing so that define their <i>own</i> functions for you to call or events to listen for), then you <i>should</i> be safe. However, <span style="color:#ff0000">PLEASE</span> take this advice with a grain of salt, as I am not a lawyer, nor do I have a lawyer with whom I can discuss topics like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have legal knowledge surrounding this though, please submit an <a href="https://github.com/TheDogOfChaos/hjson-mod-maker/issues">issue</a> on the GitHub repo for this tool.
